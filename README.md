# Introduction

My name is Lorenzo Gugliara, and I am a full-stack developer with solid experience in complex and challenging projects, both in corporate and personal contexts. I enjoy tackling technical problems with creativity and rigor, finding innovative and practical solutions.

# Main Experiences

## Kernel Sistemi Informatici

I began my career as an analyst developer at Kernel Sistemi Informatici, a consultancy company affiliated with Sistemi S.p.A., where I learned to manage projects independently and develop software solutions in the .NET environment, focusing on databases and client interfaces.

## iXenso Italy

Later, at iXenso Italy, I deepened my knowledge of modern web technologies such as Angular, React, and Docker containerization while working on large-scale projects. I learned to collaborate in teams using agile methodologies and international standards.

### Architectural Solutions

For Stellantis, I designed and implemented the current architecture for publishing and releasing commercial models across all the group's e-commerce portals (Fiat, Jeep, etc.). In addition to building a modular solution based on SOAP microservices, I developed a React endpoint serving as a management platform and KPI dashboard. This solution, still in use, improves the overall systemâ€™s efficiency by providing a centralized and intuitive multi-level system.

### Process Digitalization

For Powercloud and several German energy providers, I worked on document management, administration, and back-office processes with a focus on process digitalization. My work involved creating and managing templates for email communications, such as invoices and personalized notifications, leveraged by automated processes to generate on-demand documents dynamically adapted to end-user data, ensuring high scalability and precision in document production.

For Leonardo, I adopted a low-code/codeless approach to implement scalable and fast solutions, optimizing business processes across all internal departments and significantly reducing development times for complex industrial workflows. The projects I handled for this client, logically confidential, were part of a broader overhaul of the company's architectures and methodologies toward process digitalization.

## Alten

At ALTEN, my role as a full-stack developer involved collaborating with leading partners in the Automotive & Industry 4.0 sectors. My responsibilities ranged from consulting on 3D interfaces (HMI and SCADA) to cloud development with AWS. Key responsibilities included:

### HMI and SCADA Projects

I worked as a 3D consultant for developing Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. This role required optimizing 3D graphical solutions for monitoring and managing complex industrial processes, focusing on usability and efficiency.

### Cloud Computing and AWS

I designed and implemented solutions on AWS, leveraging cloud services to enhance scalability, security, and large-scale data management.
As a full-stack developer, I utilized technologies such as C#, SQL, and JavaScript/TypeScript to create robust and scalable applications, integrating advanced features for clients with highly specific needs.

This experience allowed me to refine my project management skills and design advanced technological solutions, consolidating my ability to adapt to complex and dynamic requirements.

# Personal Projects and Passions

Outside of my professional environment, I enjoy exploring technologies and innovative approaches that combine creativity and logic. I have participated several times in events like the Mathematics Olympiad, where I had the opportunity to hone my analytical and problem-solving skills in highly competitive contexts.

I am passionate about developing video games and experimenting with cutting-edge solutions, always seeking new technical challenges.

I have worked on experimental projects involving volumetric rendering, using advanced techniques to represent complex phenomena such as nebulae, gas, and dynamic flows in real time. In parallel, I have focused on highly detailed physical simulations, such as gravitational interactions or wave propagation, optimized for execution on consumer hardware. I have implemented graphics optimization algorithms capable of balancing visual fidelity and performance in high-intensity computational scenarios, utilizing customized pipelines.

One of my most significant works in this field was creating a volumetric shader in Blender to represent the manifold of relativistic spacetime. The shader visually depicted spacetime curvature, simulating how massive entities (like stars or black holes) influence the surrounding gravitational fabric. This project combined principles of general relativity and graphics optimization, enabling real-time calculations of manifold deformations based on provided parameters with scientific accuracy. For this project, I drew upon lectures on general relativity by Prof. Scott Hughes of MIT via OpenCourseWare.

In the field of artificial intelligence, I have participated in numerous programming challenges, including Google Hashcode and Reply Code Challenge, tackling complex problems with innovative approaches. Recently, I developed genetic algorithms to find optimal solutions in constrained computational contexts. These algorithms have proven particularly effective in combinatorial optimization scenarios and iterative simulations, allowing me to explore the intersection between artificial intelligence and algorithmic problem-solving.

## Developed Video Games

Among the most significant video games I have developed are:

- A game that simulates the entire observable universe in real time, entirely calculated through the GPU. This project included relativistic effects and a level of detail that ranged from the macroscopic representation of entire galaxies to the microscopic visualization of celestial body surfaces, all without loading screens.

- A simulator that realistically reproduces the internal combustion cycle of an engine. I implemented a quantized modeling of physical processes, achieving an extremely responsive behavior consistent with the real dynamics of an internal combustion engine.

## Foundational Experiences

In 2014/15, I contributed to founding the TechLab of Chieri, inspired by the Fablab Torino model. This technological lab was an opportunity to introduce young people and enthusiasts to the world of programming and prototyping.

During this experience, I discovered the Java language and developed innovative solutions based on Arduino, such as:

- Automation systems for doors (automatic door openers).
- Rechargeable credit keys, used for managing internal access or consumption.
- Automated flows between interconnected machinery, implementing communication and coordination logic between hardware devices.

This experience allowed me to gain practical skills in programming and hardware integration, along with a collaborative vision of technological development.
